    <h1>Spicy Mushroom Lasagna</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This lasagne pays homage to Penne all’Aconese – the first dish development chef Ixta fell madly in love with. 
        It’s served at Ristorante Pizzeria Acone, a community-run restaurant in the Tuscan village of Acone. 
        The recipe is a closely guarded secret, but the earthy and deeply umami flavour of dried porcini mushrooms is impossible to miss. 
        This is our meatless take on that mythical sauce. The ragù can easily be made vegan if you lose the cream. 
        It can also be made ahead, refrigerated, and served with pasta or polenta. If you want to get ahead, the lasagne can be assembled, 
        refrigerated and baked the next day (once it’s back to room temperature).</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
                <p><li>Put the chestnut and oyster mushrooms into the large bowl of a food processor in three or four batches and pulse each batch until 
                    finely chopped (or finely chop everything by hand). Toss the chopped mushrooms in a large bowl with 3 tablespoons of oil and 1 teaspoon 
                    of salt and spread out on a large, 40cm x 35cm parchment-lined, rimmed baking tray. Bake for 30 minutes near the top of the oven, stirring 
                    three times throughout, until the mushrooms are golden-brown; they will have reduced in volume significantly. Set aside. Reduce the oven 
                    temperature to 200°C fan.</li></p>
                <p><li>Meanwhile, combine the dried mushrooms, chillies and hot stock in a large bowl and set aside to soak for half an hour. Strain the liquid into
                     another bowl, squeezing as much liquid from the mushrooms as possible to get about 340ml: if you have any less, top up with water. 
                     Very roughly chop the rehydrated mushrooms (you want some chunks) and finely chop the chillies. Set the stock and mushrooms aside 
                     separately.</li></p>
                <p><li>Put the onion, garlic and carrot into the food processor and pulse until finely chopped (or finely chop everything by hand). 
                    Heat 60ml of oil in a large sauté pan or pot on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onion mixture and fry for 8 minutes, stirring 
                    occasionally, until soft and golden. Pulse the tomatoes in the food processor until finely chopped (or finely chop by hand), then add to the 
                    pan along with the tomato paste, 1½ teaspoons of salt and 1¾ teaspoons of freshly cracked black pepper. Cook for 7 minutes, stirring 
                    occasionally. Add the rehydrated mushrooms and chillies and the roasted mushrooms and cook for 9 minutes, resisting the urge to stir: you 
                    want the mushrooms to be slightly crisp and browned on the bottom. Stir in the reserved stock and 800ml of water and, once simmering, 
                    reduce the heat to medium and cook for about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until you get the consistency of a ragù. Stir in 100ml 
                    of the cream and simmer for another 2 minutes, then remove from the heat.</li> </p>
                <p><li>Combine both cheeses and both herbs in a small bowl. To assemble the lasagne, spread one-fifth of the sauce in the bottom of a round 28cm 
                    baking dish (or a 30cm x 20cm rectangular dish), then top with a fifth of the cheese mixture, followed by a layer of lasagne sheets, broken 
                    to fit where necessary. Repeat these layers three more times in that order, and finish with a final layer of sauce and cheese: that’s five 
                    layers of sauce and cheese and four layers of pasta.</li></p>
                <p><li>Drizzle over 1 tablespoon of cream and 1 tablespoon of oil, then cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes. Remove the foil, increase the 
                    temperature to 220°C fan and bake for another 12 minutes, turning the dish round halfway. Turn the oven to the grill setting and grill for a 
                    final 2 minutes, until the edges are brown and crisp. Set aside to cool for 5 or so minutes, then drizzle over the remaining tablespoon of 
                    cream and oil. Sprinkle over the remaining parsley, finish with a good grind of pepper and serve.</li></p>
